# Scalable Notification Service Deployment on AWS

## Introduction

jijj

This project focuses on deploying a scalable, reliable, and maintainable notification system on AWS. The system consists of two primary microservices:
- **Notification API**: Receives notification requests and queues them.
- **Email Sender**: Processes messages from the queue and sends emails.

## Requirements
### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tools
Use one of the following tools to provision infrastructure:
- Terraform
- Terraform With AWS CDK
- AWS CDK (TypeScript or Python)
- Pulumi (TypeScript or Python)

### Deployment:
- **Services**: Deploy the **Notification API** and **Email Sender** using AWS ECS Fargate.
- **Service Mesh**: Use AWS App Mesh for service mesh capabilities and AWS Cloud Map for service discovery.
- **Message Queue**: Use Amazon SQS to queue messages between services.
- **Docker Images**: Create and manage Docker images.

### Scalability and Reliability:
- Implement auto-scaling strategies based on CPU usage (70% threshold).
- Ensure system resilience and automatic recovery from failures.

### Observability:
- Set up monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch.
- Track key metrics such as queue length, processing times, and error rates.

### Security:
- Implement least-privilege IAM roles.
- Securely store sensitive information using AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of:
- **Notification API** (ECS/Fargate): Receives requests and queues them.
- **Email Sender** (ECS/Fargate): Processes queued messages and sends emails.
- **AWS App Mesh**: Provides service mesh capabilities.
- **AWS Cloud Map**: Facilitates service discovery.
- **Amazon SQS**: Queues messages between the Notification API and Email Sender.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors the system.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Provision the infrastructure using:
- **Terraform**
- **AWS CDK (TypeScript/Python)**
- **Pulumi (TypeScript/Python)**

Ensure the IaC code adheres to best practices, is well-documented, and structured properly.

## Deployment Process
1. **Review Microservices**: Understand the provided Notification API and Email Sender microservices.
2. **Design Deployment**: Plan the deployment strategy considering scalability, reliability, and security.
3. **Create Dockerfiles**: 
   - Write Dockerfiles for the Notification microservices.
   - Build and test the Docker images locally.
4. **Push to Amazon ECR**:
   - Create Amazon ECR repositories for each microservice.
   - Push the Docker images to the respective ECR repositories.
5. **Provision Infrastructure**: Use the chosen IaC tool to provision necessary AWS services.
6. **Deploy Services**: Deploy the microservices using AWS ECS Fargate.
7. **Implement Logging**: Ensure ECS tasks log application output to CloudWatch.
8. **Auto-Scaling Configuration**: Implement auto-scaling based on 70% CPU usage threshold.
9. **Health Check**: 
   - Identify health check endpoints in the microservice code.
   - Configure ECS health check paths using the identified endpoints.
10. **Test and Verify**: Ensure services are functioning correctly, can scale, and handle failures.
11. **Document**: Prepare and include a README file explaining the deployment process, architecture, and operational considerations.



## Bonus Points
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions.
- Propose and implement a strategy for zero-downtime deployments.

## Instructions
1. **Review Microservices and Configuration**: Understand the Notification API and Email Sender interaction.
2. **Design Deployment**: Strategize considering all requirements.
3. **Create Dockerfiles**: Write Dockerfiles, build, and test Docker images.
4. **Push to Amazon ECR**: Create ECR repositories and push Docker images.
5. **Provision Infrastructure**: Implement using Terraform, AWS CDK, or Pulumi.
6. **Deploy Services**: Use AWS ECS or Fargate.
7. **Implement Logging**: Ensure logs are sent to CloudWatch.
8. **Configure Auto-Scaling**: Set auto-scaling based on 70% CPU usage.
9. **Configure Health Checks**: Implement and configure health check paths.
10. **Test and Verify**: Ensure system correctness, scalability, and fault tolerance.
11. **Document**: Prepare and include a README file explaining the deployment process and architecture.

## Evaluation
Your submission will be evaluated based on:
- Quality, clarity, and maintainability of IaC code.
- Robustness and appropriateness of deployment architecture.
- Use and understanding of specified AWS services and best practices.
- Clarity and completeness of documentation and operational instructions.

## Submission
Submit your IaC code, configuration files, and README as a ZIP file or a link to a version-controlled repository (e.g., GitHub).
Fork the repo, complete the assessment, and send a pull request.

# NotificationWorkspace2

<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application
Run `npm install` and 
Run `npx nx serve pt-notification-service` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build pt-notification-service` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
